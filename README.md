# lem-redirector

This repo simply exists to redirect connections from `www.legacyminigames.xyz` to `www.legacyminigames.net` using GitHub Pages

This was made due to GitHub Pages not allowing multiple domains at once on a single repository.

If you're curious why I didn't use a URL redirect in the domain itself, those don't keep the path in the url when redirecting.

The actual html files can be found in the `main` branch
